Types, constants, variables and functions can be defined in the global scope by placing them in the global section labelled _Declarations_ or _System declarations_, or locally for a template by placing in the _Declarations_ section of a template.

Processes are instantiated by placing a [process assignments](../System_Descriptions/Process_Assignments.html) in the _System declarations_ section.

Finally, the system is defined as a parallel composition of a number of processes by placing a system declaration in the _System declarations_ section.

The syntax for each of these sections is defined in the [Language Reference](/language-reference/system-description/system-definition/template-instantiation/).

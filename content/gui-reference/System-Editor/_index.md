The system editor is used to create and edit the system to be analysed. A system description is defined by a set of process templates (possibly with local declarations), global declarations, and a system definition.

In this help section we describe how to use the left panel of the editor, called the [navigation tree](navigation-tree/), how to [draw automata](drawing/) with the editor, and where to place [declarations](declarations/). The system description language used in UPPAAL is described in the [Language Reference](/language-reference/) section.

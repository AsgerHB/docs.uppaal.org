The tools menu contains a set of tools useful in the [system edtior](../System_Editor/Introduction.html). The items are:

*   **Check Syntax:** checks if syntax and types are correct in the edited system. Any found errors and warnings are listed in the lower part of the [drawing area](../System_Editor/Drawing.html) of the system editor, and (when applicable) underlinded in the automata.
*   **Convert Syntax:** assists in convering a system complying with the syntax used in UPPAAL 3.4 to the current syntax.
*   **Align to Grid:** makes all existing objects of the current template align to the specified drawing grid.
*   **Plot Composer:** creates a new [Plot Composer](../Verifier/PlotComposer.html) window to superimpose multiple results from statistical model checking in the [Verifier](../Verifier/Introduction.html).

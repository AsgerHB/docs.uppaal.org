The process panel is the rightmost upper panel of the simulator. It displays the process instances of the system descriptions. A red token marks the current control point of each automaton. One or more of the automata edges may also be red to indicate the transition currently selected in the simulation control panel.

Clicking inside a process box with the right mouse button opens a pop-up menu with the following items:

*   **Zoom In:** increases the zoom of the process,
*   **Zoom Out:** decreases the zoom of the process,
*   **Hide:** hides the process,
*   **Export:** opens a file dialog for saving the process in encapsulated postscript format.

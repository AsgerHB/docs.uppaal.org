The Message Sequence Chart (MSC) panel is the lower rightmost panel of the simulator. It displays an MSC view of the generated trace (also displayed in the [simulation control panel](./Simulation_Control.html) of the simulator).

In the MSC view there is a vertical line for each process, and a horizontal line for each synchronisation point. The process name of each vertical line is indicated in the upper part of the MSC panel. The node names shown on the vertical lines indicate the control location of the automaton. If the mouse is placed over the MSC all control location names at the position are shown. If a position is selected, the [process panel](./Process_Window.html) and the [simulation control](./Simulation_Control.html) panel are updated accordingly.

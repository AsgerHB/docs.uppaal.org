The simulator is a validation tool that enables examination of the possible dynamic executions of a system during early design (or modeling) stages. In this sense, it provides an inexpensive mean of fault detection prior to verification by the model-checker. The simulator is also used to visualise executions (i.e. symbolic traces) generated by the verifier. Please see the [Symbolic Traces](Traces.html) section for a brief introduction of the concept.

The simulator consist of four panels: the leftmost called [simulation control](./Simulation_Control.html), the middle called [variables](./Variables_Window.html), the upper right called [processes](./Process_Window.html), and the lower right called [message sequence chart](./MSC_Window.html).

The tool bar is normally located just below the [menu bar](/gui-reference/menu-bar/) but can be moved (using the mouse) to other positions or even to a separate window. The tool bar is divided into four groups. The three leftmost groups provide quick access to some of the most frequently used menu items. The rightmost group contains editing tools.

The tool bar is normally located just below the [menu bar](../Menu_Bar/Introduction.html) but can be moved (using the mouse) to other positions or even to a separate window. The tool bar is devided into three groups. The two leftmost groups provides quick access to some of the most frequently used menu items. The rightmost group contains editing tools.

The first group contains the following buttons: _New_, _Open Project_, and _Save_. These features are described in the [File menu](../menu-bar/file/) section.

The second group contains the following buttons: _Zoom to Fit_, _Zoom In_, and _Zoom Out_. This features are described in the [View menu](../Menu_Bar/View.html) section.

The third group contains tools used in the editor for selecting and moving elements of an automaton, and for adding locations, edges and nails. This features are described in the section on [Drawing](../System_Editor/Drawing.html).

The verifier is to check safety and liveness properties by on-the-fly exploration of the state-space of a system in terms of symbolic states represented by constraints. The verification tool in UPPAAL also provides a requirement specification editor for specifying and documenting the system requirements.

In this help section we describe how to operate the verification tool, in terms of how to [specify](specifying/) and [verify](verifying/) requirements. The [requirement specification](/language-reference/requirements-specification/) language and the [verification options](/gui-reference/menu-bar/options/) are described in separate sections.

The verifier is to check safety and liveness properties by on-the-fly exploration of the state-space of a system in terms of symbolic states represented by constraints. The verification tool in UPPAAL also provides a requirement specification editor for specifying and documenting the system requirements.

In this help section we describe how to operate the verification tool, in terms of how to [specify](Specifying.html) and [verify](Verifying.html) requirements. The [requirement specification](../Requirements.html) language and the [verification options](../Menu_Bar/Options.html) are described in separate sections.

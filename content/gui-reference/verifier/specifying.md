An overview of the system requirements (called queries below and in the GUI) is shown in the panel named _Overview_ of the verifier. The toggle button _Comments/Queries_ is used to control if the queries or the comments are to be shown in the overview.

Queries are selected and de-selected using the mouse alone, or in combination with the Shift or the Control key of the keyboard (use the Shift key to (de-)select a range of entries and the Control key to (de-)select single entries). The first selected requirement and its comment is always shown in the two editor fields named _Query_ and _Comment_, where they may be edited.

New entries are added using the button named _Insert_. A new entry is inserted before the first selected entry, or appended after the last entry if no entry is selected.

The button named _Remove_ is used for deleting selected entries in the overview. Nothing is deleted if no entries are selected.

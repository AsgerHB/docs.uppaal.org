## Manual

The manual (updated 9/8/07) is available separately from the distribution. You can access it from [here](manual.pdf).


## Known Issues
  * Extrapolation option -n 4. This option should not be used, it would give wrong results.
  * It is possible to get the GUI choose randomly wrong points w.r.t. the strategy occasionally.
  * The generated C-code makes sense only for models with winning non-cooperative strategies.

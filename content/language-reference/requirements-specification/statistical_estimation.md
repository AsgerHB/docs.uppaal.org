# Confidence Interval Estimation

Statistical queries without the number of runs specified, the estimation is performed adaptively: simulate, collect the statistics and repeat if more data is needed.

The confidence intervals converge to the true probability (P) value as more samples are produced:

![CIs for P=0.5](ci_0.5.png) ![CIs for P=0.2](ci_0.2.png) ![CIs for P=0.1](ci_0.1.png) ![CIs for P=0.05](ci_0.05.png) ![CIs for P=0.01](ci_0.01.png) ![CIs for P=0](ci_0.png)

Note that occasionally the confidence intervals may overstep and thus exclude the true probability value, which should not happen more often than the specified level of significance (Î±).

The width of the confidence intervals converges to zero as more samples are produced:

![P=0.5](ciw_0.5.png) ![P=0.2](ciw_0.2.png) ![P=0.1](ciw_0.1.png) ![P=0.05](ciw_0.05.png) ![P=0.01](ciw_0.01.png) ![P=0](ciw_0.png)

Note that in case of extreme probability value (close to 0 or 1, e.g. P=0.01), repeated observations are more likely and thus they may create false confidence that the probability is extreme (i.e. 0 or 1), but then a single differing observation may disturb the interval size and therefore more samples are required than just single sided interval. Therefore newer Uppaal versions use double-sided confidence interval estimation.
